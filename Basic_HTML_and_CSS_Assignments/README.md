# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains an assignment where I used the nav element to make a home, dog picture, and puppy video tab for people to click on to navigate through the site.
When you click on the Dog Picture instead of taking you to a new site like the one under the dog category it will pull up the picture on the same web page since it is using the nav element.
The Puppy video tab will take you to a place with another link under neath called "Puppies Playing" which will then take you to a seperate link to youtube.
The home page will have a Dog, Cat, and other animals category on it.
The dog category has a quote using a blockquote element.
The cat category has a picture that you may click on and will take you to a google picture and below it is an embed youtube video.
