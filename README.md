# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains an assignment where I used the nav element to make a home, dog picture, and puppy video tab for people to click on to navigate through the site.
The home page will have a Dog, Cat, and other animals category on it.
The dog category has a quote using a blockquote element.
The cat category has a picture that you may click on and will take you to a google picture and below it is an embed youtube video.
